"""
Business-term resolution.

The profiler finds defects that are visible in the data: junk in a text column,
a cache that disagrees with its source, a NULL that spans two meanings. But
some defects are NOT statistically visible at all:

  D7  usage_events.event_ts is US/Eastern when source='batch' and UTC otherwise.
      Nothing about the values reveals that. Both look like plausible timestamps.
  D10 invoices.amount excludes tax; deals.amount includes it. Both are just
      positive decimals. No amount of profiling recovers the distinction.

That knowledge lives in people's heads, or in a wiki nobody reads. This module
is where it gets written down in a form the model can query -- the thing every
company should have and almost none do.

Honest framing for the demo: this is curated, not discovered. The harness does
not magically infer tax semantics. What it does is make institutional knowledge
retrievable at the moment the model needs it, instead of absent. That is a real
and defensible contribution -- do not oversell it as inference.
